Basic symbolic math with polynomials.  
Running this program will let you:
enter a polynomial ASCII style where exponentiation is accompliched with the caret ^,
paste in a polynomial and update terms before entering,
subscript variables (any ASCII letter) by adding numbers immediately after,
designate quatities with parentheses.
The program will simplify the polynomial 
and display it using multi-byte characters to indicate subscripts and exponents.
