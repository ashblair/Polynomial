Basic symbolic math with polynomials.
Running this program will let you: 
1) enter a polynomial ASCII style where exponentiation is accomplished with the caret ^, 
2) paste in polynomials and update terms before entering, 
3) subscript variables (which are any ASCII letter) by adding numbers immediately after and
4) designate quantities with parentheses. 

The program will:
1) simplify the polynomial and 
2) display it using multi-byte characters to indicate subscripts and exponents.
